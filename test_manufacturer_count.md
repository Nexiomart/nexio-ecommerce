# Manufacturer Count Display Test

## Implementation Summary
Added a total manufacturer count display to the admin dashboard Manufacturers section.

## Changes Made
1. **File**: `client/app/containers/Manufacturer/List.js`
   - Added import for `SearchResultMeta` component
   - Added `SearchResultMeta` component to display manufacturer count
   - Positioned after pagination and before the manufacturer list (consistent with other sections)

## How it Works
1. **Backend**: The API endpoint `/api/manufacturer` already returns a `count` field with the total number of manufacturers
2. **Frontend**: The `advancedFilters.count` in the Redux state contains this total count
3. **Display**: The `SearchResultMeta` component shows "X manufacturers" where X is the total count

## Expected Behavior
- When the Manufacturers section loads, it will display "X manufacturers" at the top
- The count reflects the total number of manufacturers in the database (not just the current page)
- The count updates dynamically when manufacturers are added/removed
- Consistent styling with other dashboard sections (Users, Merchants)

## Testing Steps
1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard â†’ Manufacturers
2. Verify that the count displays correctly (e.g., "5 manufacturers")
3. Add a new manufacturer and verify count increases
4. Remove a manufacturer and verify count decreases
5. Check that pagination doesn't affect the total count display

## Code Pattern
This follows the same pattern used in:
- Users section (`client/app/containers/Users/index.js`)
- Merchants section (`client/app/containers/Merchant/List.js`)

The implementation is consistent with existing codebase patterns and uses the existing `SearchResultMeta` component for uniform styling.
